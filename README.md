A computerized cab management system called the Mega City Cab Booking System was created to optimize the operations of Mega City Cab, a well-known taxi service in Colombo. Customers can book taxis, drivers can manage assigned trips, and administrators can effectively oversee operations thanks to this system's automated, user-friendly platform, which replaces laborious booking processes.
